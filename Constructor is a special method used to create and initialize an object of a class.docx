Constructor is a special method used to create and initialize an object of a class.
Destructor id used to destroy the object.
We’ll   create a class student with an instance variable student name. we’ll  see how to use a constructor to initialize the student name at the time of object creation.
Using self, we can access the instance variable and instance method of the object.
class Student:
    def __init__(self,name):
         self.name=name
    def show(self):
        print('Hello, my name is', self.name)
s1=Student('Emma')
s1.show()
output :-  Hello, my name is Emma

class Student:
    def __init__(self,name):
         self.name=name
    def show(self):
        print("My name:", self.name)
s1=Student("iot")
s1.show()
output :- My name: iot
