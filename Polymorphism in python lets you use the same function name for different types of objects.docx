	Polymorphism in python lets you use the same function name for different types of objects.
•	This means one function or method can act in many forms.
•	It makes your code flexible and easy to manage.
•	It helps you write code that can work with various objects.
•	You do not need to know their exact type.
•	This saves time.
•	It also makes your programs more adaptable.
	3 WAYS TO USE POLYMORPHISM IN PYTHON

•	You can use polymorphism in python in a few ways:
•	With built in functions: Python’s own functions often use polymorphism.
•	With class method: different classes can have methods that share the same name.
•	With inheritance(method overriding): child classes can change methods they get fom their parent classes.
	Polymorphis, with built-in- functions
Many built-in python functions work in different ways. Their action changes based on the type of data you give them . the len() function is a good example
•	When you use len() on a string, it  counts the characters.
•	When you use len() on a list, it counts the items.
•	When you use len() on a dictionary, it counts the keys.
Here’s how len() works
# use len() with a string
My string = “hello”
Print(len(my string))
#use len() with a list
My list = [1,2,3,4]
Print(len(my list))
#use len() with a dictionary
My dict={“a”:1,”b”:2}
Print(len(my dict))
