Encapsulation means hiding internal details of a class and only ex

Encapsulation in python involves bundling data(attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, Typically a class .
 it aims to restrict direct access to some of an objects components, preventing uniutended modification and promoting data integrity.
While python does not enforce strict access modifier like public, private, or protected as in some other languages, encapsulation is achieved thorugh conventions and name mangling.
Access Specifiers :
Access specifier define how class members (variable and methods) can be accessed from outside the class. They help in implementing encapsulation by controlling the visiblility of data. There are three types of access specifiers:

                          Types of access modifier

Public                          protected                        private

1.public members
Ex: this example shows how a public attribute(name) and a public method (display_name) can be accessed from outside the class using an object.
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name   #public attribute

    def display_name(self):
        print(self.name)

emp = Employee("Raju ❤chitti")
emp.display_name()   # accessible
print(emp.name)       #accessible

protected members
protected members  are variables or methods that are intended to be accessed only within the class and its subclasses. They are not strictly private but should be treated as internal.
Ex: this example shows how a protected attribute (_age) can be accessed within a subclass , demonstrating that protected members are meant for use within the class and its subclasses.
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name#public
        self._age = age #protected

class SubEmployee(Employee):
    def show_age(self):
        print("Age:", self._age)

emp = SubEmployee("raju",23):
print(emp.name)
emp.show_age()

3. private members
Private members are variables or methods that cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. They are used to retrict access and protect internal data.
In python, private members are defined with a double with a double underscore prefix (eg,, self.__salary).python applies name mangling by internally renaming them
(eg,, __salary becomes_ClassName__salary)to prevent direct access.
Ex:  this example shows how a private attribute(__salary) is accessed within the class using a public method, demonstrating that private members cannot be accesed directly from outside the class.
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.name = name#public
        self.__salary = salary #protected

    def show_salary(self):
        print("Salary:", self.__salary)
        
emp.Employee("Robert", 2000)
print(emp.name)
emp.show_salary()
# print(emp.__salary)
